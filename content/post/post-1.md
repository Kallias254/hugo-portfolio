## **Introduction**

In today's digital landscape, hosting multiple websites on a single server can offer significant advantages in terms of cost efficiency and manageability. This guide will walk you through setting up two WordPress sites on a single Amazon Lightsail server using Bitnami, known for its ease of deployment and pre-configured environments. Whether you're setting up blogs, business sites, or portfolios, this step-by-step guide aims to streamline the process for you.

## **Setting Up the Bitnami Instance**

Amazon Lightsail is renowned for its simplicity and affordability, making it an ideal platform for hosting WordPress sites. Begin by selecting a Lightsail plan and choosing the Bitnami WordPress stack for your instance. This setup provides a pre-installed WordPress environment, allowing you to jump straight into site customization.

## **Preparing for Multiple Sites**

A clear directory structure is crucial for managing multiple sites on one server. For this guide, we'll use:

- **`/opt/bitnami/site1/wordpress`** for **`writewithcaren.com`**
- **`/opt/bitnami/site2/wordpress`** for **`scholarsummit.org`**

After setting up the directories, download and install WordPress in each. This separation ensures that each site operates independently within the same server.

## **Configuring Apache Virtual Hosts**

Apache Virtual Hosts (vhosts) are essential for hosting multiple domains on a single server. They direct traffic to the appropriate site based on the requested domain.

### **Site1 Configuration: `writewithcaren.com`**

For **`writewithcaren.com`**, set up virtual hosts for HTTP and HTTPS. Key directives include **`ServerName`**, **`DocumentRoot`**, and **`AllowOverride All`** for **`.htaccess`** support, crucial for WordPress permalinks.

### **Site2 Configuration: `scholarsummit.org`**

The configuration for **`scholarsummit.org`** mirrors that of the first site, adjusting for its unique domain and document root. This ensures that each site is served from its dedicated directory.

## **Securing Your Sites with SSL**

Securing your sites with SSL certificates is vital for protecting user data and improving site credibility. Use Bitnami's **`bncert-tool`** to automate SSL certificate generation and configuration:

1. SSH into your server and run **`sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool`**.
2. Specify the domains for SSL certificates, like **`scholarsummit.org`** and **`www.scholarsummit.org`**.
3. The tool will generate SSL certificates and update Apache configurations to use them.

### **Finalizing SSL Setup**

After SSL setup:

1. Restart Apache with **`sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache`**.
2. Verify the secure connection by checking for the padlock icon in the browser's address bar.

**Image Suggestion**: The browser's address bar showing the padlock icon, indicating a secure connection.

## **Finalizing and Testing**

With your sites configured and SSL secured, test the Apache configuration with **`sudo apachectl configtest`**. Accessing your sites should now display the WordPress installation screen, signifying a successful setup.

## **Conclusion**

Hosting multiple WordPress sites on a single Bitnami instance on Amazon Lightsail is an efficient way to manage several projects. By following this guide, you've set up, secured, and prepared your sites for launch, all within a single, manageable environment. This approach not only simplifies web hosting but also ensures that your sites are secure and performant.
